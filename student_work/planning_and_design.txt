Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step

Game Idea:
Doodle jump but with better items

Game Rules:
You jump on platforms and if you fall of you die.
Pick up items as you go to progress faster or die.
Goal is to get the highest score possible without dying

Major Game Elements:
Platorms, movement, Jumping, items, Main menu/Gameplay, pause menu, score counter
[items
-bounce pads
-propeller suit
-jump potion
-crumble platforms] (if we complete original idea)

the game constantly scrolls up unless jumping off platorm which makes it scroll down.
If you drop below the 'line' then you lose and it presents a death screen showing your score and a restart button
if you stay on a platform for to long a 'lava line' will apeare and if you touch it you lose
as your score gets higher lava rises faster and jump a little higher just to make the game faster pased as you go on

The platforms will be created at random x values and random y values (within reason)
once they get to the bottom of the line they will move back to the top randomizing the x position. there will only be about 5 platforms that go down then back up.
Gameplay Process:
press 'space' to start the game then 'up arrow' makes you jump. 'left and right arrow' lets you move left and right.
